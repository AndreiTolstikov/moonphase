----------------------------------

    The Moon is one of the most enigmatic and mystical planets of the Solar system.

    A.V.T. Software presents MoonPhase Web App for calculating 
    and displaying the current Moon Phase, and the Lunar Day.

    MoonPhase Web App uses the W3C Geolocation API (GeoIP).
    
    The MoonPhase Web App was designed for educational and cognitive purposes.

    The first release of the MoonPhase Web App was created to participate in 
    the international competition Intel AppUp Developer Challenge: Web Apps Edition, 
    organized by Intel in January 2012.
    
    In August 2017 the A.V.T. Software( https://software.avt.dn.ua ) team 
    has made a decision to publish the MoonPhase Web App on GitHUB 
    as an open source project.
    
    In honor of the fifteenth anniversary of A.V.T. Company ( https://avt.dn.ua ).
